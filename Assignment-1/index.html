                <p>The official lyrics to “Sweater Weather” appear below.</p>

                <pre>
                    [Verse 1]
                    And all I am is a man
                    I want the world in my hands
                    I hate the beach, but I stand
                    In California with my toes in the sand
                    Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
                    Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
                    Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
                    You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    She knows what I think about
                    And what I think about
                    One love, two mouths
                    One love, one house
                    No shirt, no blouse
                    Just us, you find out
                    Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

                    [Chorus]
                    'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
                    So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

                    [Verse 2]
                    And if I may just take your breath away
                    I don't mind if there's not much to say
                    Sometimes the silence guides a mind
                    To move to a place so far away
                    The goosebumps start to raise
                    The minute that my left hand meets your waist
                    And then I watch your face
                    Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
                    These hearts adore
                    Everyone the other beats hardest for
                    Inside, this place is warm
                    Outside, it starts to pour
                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    Comin' down
                    One love, two mouths
                    One love, one house
                    No shirt, no blouse
                    Just us, you find out
                    Nothin' that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
                    No, no, no

                    [Chorus]
                    'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
                    So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                    'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
                    So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                    Woah

                    [Bridge]
                    Woah, woah, woah
                    Woah, woah, woah, woah
                    Woah, woah
                    Woah, woah, woah, woah
                    Woah, woah

                    [Chorus]
                    'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
                    So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                    'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
                    Let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                    [Outro]
                    And it's too cold, it's too cold
                    The holes of my sweater
                </pre>
